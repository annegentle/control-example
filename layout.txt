# Comments start with a "#" character. Whitespace-only lines are ignored.

# Begin each file by specifying the domain that its mappings belong to, surrounded by square
# brackets.

# You may introduce a new domain at any time and it will be active until the end of the file
# or another domain is specified. You must specify at least one before you introduce any mappings.

# Each mapping consists of:
# - The destination path prefix; the location on the final, rendered site at which this content
#   will be available.
# - The "content ID" of the content to attach here. Generally, this will be the base URL of the
#   git repository that houses the raw content.
# Separate these two by whitespace on a single line.

/python-guide  https://github.com/kennethreitz/python-guide/

# The *longest path prefix* in the mapping file that matches a specific request URL will be applied
# to generate the corresponding content ID. For example, given the mappings above:
#
# "GET /running/architecture" will render:
# "https://github.com/deconst/deconst-docs/running/architecture"
#
# "GET /python-guide/writing/gotchas" will render:
# "https://github.com/kennethreitz/python-guide/writing/gotchas"

# As your sites grow, you may distribute your mappings across many files and many directories within
# the mapping repository. All files should end with the ".txt" suffix. This is purely for you: the
# mapping service will concatenate them all to generate the final map. It's an error to attempt to
# map anything to the same path prefix twice. This is to keep you from clobbering a previous mapping
# without realizing it!
